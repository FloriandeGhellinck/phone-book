# Phone-book

## Description

Phone-book is a contacts management app. It allows users to consult, create, edit, and delete contacts. Users can search for a contact using the name or phone number of their contact.

You can see the project in action [here](https://phone-book-fdg.vercel.app/).

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set up your environment variables. Feel free to contact me to get the .env variables, if I didn't sent you them.

3. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
